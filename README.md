# Web Player Supporting Hls Playlists  

In order to implement this project I used the following libraries:  
* [plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#options) - a lightweight, greatly customizable, pure HTML based video and audio player  
* [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) - as the native support for the hls playlists is still not common in the most frequently used browsers, this js library adds the needed support for loading the provided manifest files.
